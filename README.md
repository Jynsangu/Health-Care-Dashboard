This dashboard provides the management team with valuable insights into patient satisfaction and care quality across facilities. It allows each facility to assess how well their patients are responding to the services provided. By tracking key performance indicators and achievements, the dashboard highlights areas that need improvement, empowering facilities to enhance their services and overall patient experience.

##Design considerations

The dashboard is to have a page navigation that is well designed, functional and ensure ease of access to the users. 

It has 4 tabs:
1. PMTCT Cascade (Prevention of Mother to Child Transmissions (of HIV)) 
2. Positivity cascade (HIV positives and Negatives within PMTCT)
3. Syphilis cascade (Syphilis tests amongst the PMTCT patients)
4. Cohort Analysis (HIV status outcomes of up to 18 months for children who were exposed to HIV from birth)

The range of colors ensures the dashboard is visually appealing, capturing the audience's attention and providing an enjoyable experience for both users and viewers.

DAX Calculations was applied to allow for the calculation of percentage achievements against targets and are displayed as KPI cards. For the PMTCT Cascade, a 100% Stacked column chart was utilized to create the KPI like visuals.

This dashboard helps the overall management team understand their patients better. It helps each facility know if their patients are satisfied with the care services offered by the facility. Through their achievements, they get to know their improvement areas, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these areas.

##Design considerations

The dashboard is to have a page navigation that is well designed, functional and ensure ease of access to the users. 

It has 4 tabs:
1. PMTCT Cascade (Prevention of Mother to Child Transmissions (of HIV)) 
2. Positivity cascade (HIV positives and Negatives within PMTCT)
3. Syphilis cascade (Syphilis tests amongst the PMTCT patients)
4. Cohort Analysis (HIV status outcomes of up to 18 months for children who were exposed to HIV from birth)

The range of colors ensures the dashboard is visually appealing, capturing the audience's attention and providing an enjoyable experience for both users and viewers.

DAX Calculations was applied to allow for the calculation of percentage achievements against targets and are displayed as KPI cards. For the PMTCT Cascade, a 100% Stacked column chart was utilized to create the KPI like visuals.
